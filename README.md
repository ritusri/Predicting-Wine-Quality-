# Predicting-Wine-Quality-
Testing the quality of wine and tasting it requires manpower and equipment. The aim of the project is to reduce man power which wine companies hire to taste the quality of wine before launching into the market. They are spending huge amount on hiring healthy volunteers and on their retention policies/strategies. We would like to predict the quality of wine based on chemical properties which are already known and easy to calculate using sensors.

Our task is to build classiÔ¨Åcation models which will classify the quality of wine depending on multiple physico-chemical factors. Given below is a sample of the data set that we are using to predict the quality of wine:
